	<h2> <span STYLE="font-style: Bold"> The Truth About Depression </span></h2>
	<p> Waking up in the morning has been inredibly difficult. Your body does not want to move. It feels as though you could just sink to the floor and dissappear without a soul even noticing your abscence. You would much rather remain in your warm queen-sized bed where no one is looking at you. This is your safe place, where you do not feel judged. Here, you feel secure from the harsh scrutinty outside, so you do not feel the need to venture anywehere but where you are now.
	<p> Hi, I'm your depression, and I have become your only friend.<p>
	<p>According to the American Psychiatric Association, depression is more than sadness. Individuals who experience depression not only maintain a lack of interest in activities that they used to find pleasure in, but they may also experience physical changes as well. These changes include weight loss or gain, insomnia or excessive sleeping, a lack of energy, and the inability to concentrate. The more severe indicators of depression include persistent thoughts of death or suicide. If you or an individual you know is experincing any of these symptoms, do not worry. Many individuals feel this way at one point or another. The best thing you can do is reach out, and know that you are not alone.<p> 
	<p> Though experiencing depression can be scary, it is acually not something to fear as it is imensely treatable though a combination of therapy and antidepressants. <mark> For more information on the symptoms and risks of depression visit,</mark>  <a href="https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-depression">Facts About Depression</a></p>
